# Usage: surf rails <url> <name>
# Summary: set up an ubuntu server with a rails application stack.
# Help: Run `surf rails` from your rails application directory.
# The <url> parameter should be a url to the server you want to deploy to. You
# need to have root access to this server, and public-key authentication
# is recommended as surf will run many commands over ssh.
#
# The <name> parameter is the name of your application. This will be
# used as the user name, database name, and folder name of the application.
#
# When complete, a git remote with the name of <url> will be added. Push
# to that remove for subsequent deploys.
